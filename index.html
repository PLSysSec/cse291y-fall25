    **CSE 291-Y: Building Secure Systems with Rust**
          [*Deian Stefan*](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/)

About
==============================================================

This course will explore how using a language like Rust with a powerful type 
system and strong safety guarantees affects the design of secure systems. Do the 
safety guarantees provided by Rust (e.g., memory safety) make it easier 
to provide stronger guarantees using techniques like verification? What classes 
of vulnerabilities can we completely eliminate by cleverly taking advantage of Rust's 
type system? Where and how do Rust's safety guarantees break down when applied 
to low-level systems code? To (start to) answer these questions, students will read
and discuss recent research papers in the field and conduct a relevant 
quarter-long research project in small groups.
